# edzy

edzy is an on-chain ZKp powered tutoring platform which eliminates the need for third-party student-teacher matching services. 
Upon lesson completion, tutors get paid instantly and the students get a chance to mint an NFT which can then be added to their on-chain badge identity. 
With the help of token-gating, we ensure security and flexibility of tutoring never seen before.
